# CRUD
Basic create, update, read, delete

Basically, it is just simple contact page that can store/retrive user information using the 
backend : Node.js 
frontend : Angular.js
database : mysql

For the understanding flow,
1. Focus on the backend first that use only index.js with a few method ( create&connect db, CRUD coding;can use Postman to test the function)
2. Proceed to frontend; angular using service api to connect the backend 
( CRUD method in the view/read ; app.routing.ts, apiservive.app , read.component.html, read.component.ts, create.component.ts, create.component.html)
